# Photography Portfolio Wesbite

This project is a mock photography portfolio website developed using HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, and Bootstrap. The purpose of this project was to create a responsive and visually appealing portfolio site showcasing photography work while following a structured UI/UX design process.

### This project is part of my final project for the UI/UX core elective course in my MSc

## Design & Development Process
1. Wireframing

The initial wireframes were created using **Pencil** software. This step focused on determining the layout, navigation structure, and overall design elements that would best suit a photography portfolio.


2. Prototyping

Following wireframing, a high-fidelity prototype was created in **Figma**. The prototype included interactions, color schemes, typography, and spacing, ensuring a cohesive user experience before moving into development.
